# Data science and Social Housing
Last winter a lot of people in my city were stuck sleeping in the cold. The city's shelter referral service was giving out incorrect capacity numbers and referrals. People would arrive to emergency shelters just to get turned away because it was full! While other shelters were at a tenth of their capacity!! 7 people died from expose to the elements. I don't want this to ever happen again. 

I believe that if the shelter referral had a better model for the distribution of capacity in shelters across the city, their referrals would have been more accurate, and no one would have gone without shelter. 

I'd like to improve my research skills through learning to apply data science techniques so that I can learn to improve social infrastructure in my city.
